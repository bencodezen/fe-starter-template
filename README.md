# BenCodeZen's Front-End Starter Template

Let's face it. There was a time once where all you had to do was write HTML, CSS and JS and that was all there was to having (more or less) production ready code.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade that for the world when you consider all the cool new toys we get to play with now. But let's be honest with ourselves, getting from point A to point B is a lot harder these days.

Luckily for us, [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) came out recently and I canno tell you how simple it made this idea of mine come to life. So here's a basic front-end template to get you from dev code to production with even less configuration.

_Note: This will be updated as time goes on and I find gaps in this setup and will enhance it as I go!_

## Features

* Hot module reloading!
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) pre-processor already configured!\*
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) ready to go!
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiling so you can use shiny new ES6+ syntax!

\* _There is a known issue with hot module reloading at the moment, but hopefully that will be resolved soon!_
